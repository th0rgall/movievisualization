This is an interactive visualization of all the movies and series I have seen since 2015.

[Check here](http://web.thorgalle.me/movieviz/) for a live version.

### Mini usage guide: 

- It has two views. One shows the movies stacked by release date, the other one shows them stacked by week that I watched them. Toggle these views from the menu or by pressing "R" or "W".
- See movie details and maybe my mini-review by clicking/tapping a movie.
- Highlight my favorites by click the menu option or pressing "F".

For more information about why and how I made this, refer to [this blog post](http://web.thorgalle.me/movieviz/).
